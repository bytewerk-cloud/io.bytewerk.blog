## üôã Personal

- Started picking up playing the Guitar again, which feels nice. I'm currently learning to play [Black Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OS8taasZl8k) and a couple of songs by [Ghost](https://ghost-official.com/).
- Getting back into playing Warhammer 40k (yes! the tabletop!) with actual friends in physical stores again.
- Still moving apartments, setting up our new place, and exploring the new environment.
