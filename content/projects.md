# My private projects

- Lipwig, my custom and totally not naming rights infringing book keeping and invoicing solution for the Swiss market. I plan to open source it in the future, under a proper name.

## Games

- I've created a bunch of game jam distributions, but I'm currently working towards resurfacing a mobile game concept which I have not seen in the wilds for the past 15 years or so. I will share more information once I get it to a presentable state.
