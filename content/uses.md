# Uses

For more information, see [here](https://uses.tech/).

## Operating Systems
- [*I use Arch by the way*](https://i.redd.it/yf4j8mde9n341.jpg), mainly because for me, it is the best compromise between ease of use and being able to setup a small console system with minimal dependencies. I also appreciate the bleeding edge and AUR stuff, though it can cause problems.
- Lately though, I've been toying with the idea of exploring [Nix](https://nixos.org/) or [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/).

## Hardware
- i7-12700K, mostly because it was still the best option for single core performance when it came out.
- GeForce 1080 TI, because it simply won't break.
- ASUS TUF GAMING Z690-PLUS WIFI D4, for those sweet gaming benefits and RGBlingbling.
- 64GB of RAM, because have you tried to run Zoom, Discord, Slack and Chrome at the same time?
- Fractal Design Define 7, because I love their aesthetic.
- Some old Zowie FK1 that I hope never dies, because I've grown very fond of it and it's basically out of production nowadays.
- Keychron Q1, because I enjoy the layout, and native VIA support is a killer feature for me. Every time I need some archaic incantation, I simply setup a new key code in the GUI and I'm done. I seriously cannot stress enough how much I enjoy being able to map any functionality to any of my keys. I will never be able to go back again from this.

## Software
- [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), mainly because I wanted to push the envelope by leaving X11 behind and finally moving on to Wayland, over 10 years of reading about how it was "now the new standard"... I also appreciate the customizability. For me, it features the best of both worlds of tiling and floating WMs.
- [Hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper), [Hyprlock](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprlock), [https://github.com/hyprwm/hypridle](https://github.com/hyprwm/hypridle) ... You get the idea.
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), because it's fast, supports ligatures and has a lot of features like built-in multiplexing that I've grown to like.
- `neovim`, ~because I'm a masochist~ because `emacs` is simply too much for my endevours. I used to run my own setup, but have lately moved on to [lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), mainly because it's fast, highly customizable and I don't have to worry about breaking changes.
- [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi), because midnight commander made my terminal crash more than once.
- [spotify_player](https://github.com/aome510/spotify-player), because I like not having to pick up the mouse to interact with my listening experience.
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/de/firefox/), because I don't like Chrome, and Mozilla has really stepped up their game again over the past 5 years or so. Also, it's basically the only realistic alternative to Chrome (no, webkit does not count).
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/), because some of the pages I need to use for work are simply not compatible with Firefox. Looking at you there, [Figma](https://www.figma.com)...
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), because I like the idea of having my notes in a markdown format that I can easily access and edit with any text editor. The plugin support is fcantastic, but I'm still looking for a reliable way to sync across devices, especially IOS.
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), because I like the open source approach, as well as the community. 
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) and [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) for gaming.

## Tech Stacks

- [Go](https://go.dev/), because it's easy to pick up and enables me to program in a large variety of paradigms. It's well supported and I get shit done.
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), because I like a language that prevents me from doing stupid things.
- [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and [alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for frontend stuff, because it feels like the best compromise between feature rich, modern web development while keeping bloat to an absolute minimum. Also, HATEOAS just reminds me of my youth, before someone decided JS was a great idea for backends.
- `python` for everything else, mostly because you cannot escape it these days.

## Other

- I like `Erlang`, `Lisp`, and [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), but have yet do build something meaningful with either of those.
- I used to write `C#` for a living, but have moved away from it years ago. I still think it's a decent language though, I'm just not looking for the corporate working conditions it usually brings along.
- I also speak some `C` and `C++`, I like working with embedded or distributed systems, I love baking my own pizza and I enjoy a good dram of single malt Whisky.
